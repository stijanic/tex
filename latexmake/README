Readme begins:

This is a generic makefile to create output from a Latex file.

It will run the designated LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until all
cross-references are resolved, building all indices.  The directory
containing each FILE is searched for included files.

It can also generate .html, .txt or .rtf files.

To get help, type 'make help'
